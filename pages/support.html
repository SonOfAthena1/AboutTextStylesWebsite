      <h1>Trouble Shooting Guide/Common Problems:</h1>
      <h3>Your Style Is Not Working Properly</h3>
      <p>If clicking ‘Apply Style’ results in something different from what you wanted, you might have entered something wrong, in which case the program resets to its defaults. Double-check that you’ve correctly entered all information, for example, the font is spelled correctly and the colors are in proper hex format (i.e., #0084ff). You can find the hex value of any color using the Google Docs Custom Color feature or using any number of online tools.</p>

      <h3>Not Saving Styles Before Using Them</h3>
      <p>Not saving a style before trying to use it can cause some problems. It’s always best practice to save a style before trying to use it.</p>

      <h3>Clicking ‘view less’ Options Before Saving</h3>
      <p>After clicking ‘view more styling options’, you’ll see additional styling options available like ‘font-size’, ‘underline’, ‘bold’, and ‘italicize’. However, if you select different advanced styling options and don’t save the style before clicking ‘view less’, all your selections will be reset to their defaults.</p>

      <h3>Trying To Get Styling To Work Across New Lines</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, by the nature of Google Docs, styling across new lines (paragraph breaks) is nonviable. If you try to put a start character here like this &lt; and then have text on a new line like this &gt;, it will not work. However, if you really need this to work, you can press ‘Shift+Enter’ (called a soft break) instead of just ‘Enter’, and it will work then. Otherwise, you need to place an ending marker at the end of every paragraph and before a new line.</p>

      <h3>Saving a New Style With the Same Name as a Previous One</h3>
      <p>Unique names are required for all styles. Trying to save a new style with the same name as an old one will only result in the old style being overwritten.</p>

      <h3>Recurring Problem That Was Not Covered Here</h3>
      <p>If you’ve noticed a recurring problem that hasn’t been mentioned above, please give me a description of the issue <a href="https://github.com/SonOfAthena1/Text-Styles-Google-Docs-Extension/issues" target="_blank">Here</a>. Click on the green ‘Issue’ button in the top right corner, add a title and description, then scroll down and click the green ‘Create’ button in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>
