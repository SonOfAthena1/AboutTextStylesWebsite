## About the Add-on

**Text Styles** is an all-purpose Google Docs markdown add-on that allows you to create your own custom style markdowns and save them for later use.  

For example, you could define a style called **"Code"** with:
- Font set to **Consolas**  
- Highlight color set to `#efefef` (light gray)  
- `<` and `>` as style markers  

You could then write something like `<print("Hello World")>` in Python or `<System.out.println("Hello World")>` in Java, and with one click, Text Styles will apply the saved formatting and optionally remove the markers.
